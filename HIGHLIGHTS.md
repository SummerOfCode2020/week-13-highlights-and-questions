	let dogAge = 0;

	humanAge = 16 * Math.ln * (dogAge) + 31};`

1. After completing the React tutorial and successfully re-creating the tic-tac-toe game, I find React very interesting and am excited to learn more and implement it in the future!

1. React storefront pulling in and showing data from another port such as week 10 API store manager.  Fetch() function

Fun fact: The meaning of a response code from the server varies from API to API, and oftentimes checking response.ok might not be enough. For example, some APIs will return a 200 response even if your API key is invalid. Always read the API documentation!

2. I like how easy it is to setup tables in react using bootstrap

I like the carousel where the component cycle through the slides
